This project has consisted of the realization of my first portfolio. Its purpose is to make a brief presentation about me and show a little of the projects I have done so far.

The technologies used have been HTML and CSS. I have tried to use most of the techniques studied in Bootcamp. To write the code I used Visual Studio Code and the Google Chrome code inspection tool has been very useful.
